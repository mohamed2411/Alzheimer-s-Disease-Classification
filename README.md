# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Classification
# Convolutional Neural Networks for multi class Classification of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease


building a piece of software that can classify Alzheimer's disease stage.I will take the advantage of the evolution in the computation power of computers over the last decade to build a solution for our problem. This computation power will allow us to use one of the most powerful artificial neural networks. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN's are extremely brilliant at dealing with image data. Also, the inception v3 model is a CNN pre-trained model that has good accuracy when dealing with images.
